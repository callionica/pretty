# pretty

This code is an Objective C++ header file that provides the ability to create a pretty URL for display to the user.

Call `pretty(url)` to get an `NSString*` that is easier to read than a standard URL.

The input `url` can be `NSURL*` or `NSURLComponents*`.

<!--Here's a standard URL:

And here's the pretty version:-->
